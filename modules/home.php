     	<p id="intro">Our pick Kia Sportage 1.6 GDi 2
            Used deals from £8,495
            Monthly finance from £150*

            Kia’s seven-year warranty and reputation for practical design have always made the brand a sensible choice, but the current Sportage adds extra appeal, with an original design and steering that’s responsive and accurate, for smooth and involved driving. It also offers a large boot and good rear legroom and best of all that warranty is transferable to those who buy one as a used car.

            The latest generation of the Sportage was launched in 2016 and early models offer fantastic value, with finance payments starting at £160 per month. Both petrol and diesel models cost from less than £12,000.

            Even entry-level ‘1’ models include alloy wheels, air-conditioning, all-round electric windows and Bluetooth for connecting your phone wirelessly. Sat-nav and parking sensors come as standard on grade 2 and above.

    <h2>List of the favorites cars:</h2>
	<div class="vest">
    	<h3>Mazda CX-5 2.2D Sport Nav</h3>
        <img src="images/main/mazda_cx5.jpg" style="width:200px; height:auto;" alt="vest1">
        <p>It might have been replaced by an all-new model several years back, but Mazda’s previous-generation CX-5 remains an excellent family car: an excellent example of a crossover that combines the practicality of a traditional hatchback with the higher driving position of an off-road car.</p>

    	<h3>Skoda Octavia 1.4 TSI SE</h3>
        <img src="images/main/2017_skoda_octavia.jpg" style="width:200px; height:auto;" alt="vest2">
        <p>If your family hatchback feels cramped, then there's no need to buy a boxy estate car or a tall and chunky crossover: you just need a Skoda Octavia. The car is enormous inside when you compare it to a Ford Focus or Vauxhall Astra, with a huge boot and plenty of legroom for passengers in the back. The economical engines and competitive pricing all combine to make it BuyaCar's best family hatchback.</p>

     <div class="vest">
        <h3>Range Rover Evoque 2.2 SD4 Pure Tech</h3>
        <img src="images/main/2011_range_rover_evoque_ftq.jpg" style="width:200px; height:auto;" alt="vest2">
        <p>Range Rover Evoque prices continue to fall, following the launch of a new model, making popular versions of this in-demand car affordable for those with £20,000 or £250 per month to spend. That now buys you an entry level (but still luxurious) version.</p>
