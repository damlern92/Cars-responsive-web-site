			<h2>Audi Q3 2.0 TFSI quattro SE S tronic</h2>
			<p>
				With the arrival of an all-new Audi Q3, the previous-generation has become a lot more affordable. You can pick up a five-year old model for around £15,000 but if your budget will stretch to it, then there are four-wheel drive, automatic cars

			<h3>Jaguar XE 2.0D R-Sport</h3>
			<p>
				You won't need anything like £20,000 for a high-specification version of Jaguar’s smallest saloon. It’s more than a match for the BMW 3 Series, thanks to its excellent blend of comfort, power and agility in corners.The rear seats can be a little cramped if you’re taller than average, but there is plenty of room for children. R-Sport cars look the part, thanks to beefier front and rear bumpers, as well as larger alloy wheels.

			<h3>Mercedes SLC 250d AMG Line</h3>
			<p>
				Stylish top-down motoring can be yours this summer, as prices of three- and four-year old Mercedes SLC models dip below £25,000. Many of these cars have covered less than 5,000 miles and all have hard folding tops, which makes the model more secure when parked and cosier when it gets cold.
